Suddenly, from nowhere appears a blue ghost. 


"Hello mister. Yesterday we played cards and you lost.
Because of that you had to gave me something yours.
But you are a cheater and you item worths nothing.
So today I will let you get it back.
But nothing is free in this world.
Shall we play a game?

I will pick a number from 1 to 6 and you have to guess correct number.
You are correct - you get your belonging back.
You are wrong - you go away with nothing.

Give me a minute...
Ok, I have a number in my mind.
Guess it!"

Type a number from 1 to 6 in order to get your belonging.
