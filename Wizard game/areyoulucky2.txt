After your long walk, surprisingly you see a little girl.
A lonely little girl in the forest. Strange situation.
You should be more careful, but you really want this journey to finish.

"Good morning.", she said.
"My mommie gave me this bag and forced to sit here and wait for someone.
Do you, by any chance, know whom does this bag belong to?
It's cold and dark in here and I want to go home."

Of course it was your bag.

"But mum asked me to play a game with you.
I will pick a number from 1 to 6 and you have to guess correct number.
You are correct - you get your belonging back.
You are wrong - you go away with nothing.

Give me a minute...
Ok, I have a number in my mind.
Guess it!"

Type a number from 1 to 6 in order to get your belonging.
