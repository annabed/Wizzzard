After a long walk you finally see a human being. 
A slim person in a long coat with a big hood.
A woman.
From the moment she saw you she shouts.
SHOUTS.
REALLY.
LOUD.

"You, you, you ugly human being!
How dare you to come here after what you did yesterday?!"

And so on, and so on.
Your hangover is getting worse and worse.

Do you decide to interrupt her?
