There was a tiny path just behind you, you choose to take it.
After only a few meters you see something shining in the dark.
"My knife" you think.
It is your knife ideed.
But when you want to take it, a little dwarf appears from nowhere.

"Why so in hurry? Why?"
"I will give you a puzzle, you solve it, you get your knife back."
"Agree?"

You don't really have choice.

"So tell me what is the solution of this: 6:3*(1+2)!"

Take your time and type your answer.
