You've decided to stay where you are and wait for a miracle. 
You sit on the grass and not after a long time you fall asleep.
In your dream you saw a dog holding your wand.
"Give it back", you shouted.
And for your big surprise, it left it beside you.
Then you suddenly wake up and see your belonging beside you.
"Uff, what a luck.", you think.
